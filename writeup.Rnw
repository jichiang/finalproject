\subsection*{Data Description: NCbirths}
This dataset was acquired from OpenIntro.org's free collection. According to the metadata, `ncbirths' was released in 2004 by North Carolina. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. The data provided by OpenIntro is a random sample of 1,000 cases from this data set.
